## Hardware Requirements

- **Microcontroller**: RP2040 board (Raspberry Pi Pico, Waveshare RP2040-Zero, etc.)
- **PS/2 Connector**: 6-pin Mini-DIN female connector
- **Mode Switch**: SPST switch or jumper
- **Button**: Single momentary switch (demo uses 'A' key)
- **Level Shifter** (recommended): Bidirectional logic level converter or transistor-based shifter

### ⚠️ Important: Voltage Level Considerations

**The RP2040 is a 3.3V device, while PS/2 protocol typically operates at 5V.**

- **RP2040 GPIO**: 3.3V logic levels
- **PS/2 Standard**: 5V logic levels

**Options:**

1. **Direct Connection (3.3V PS/2)** - Works with many modern PS/2 hosts
   - RP2040 outputs 3.3V, which is often sufficient for PS/2 receivers
   - RP2040 inputs are 5V tolerant when configured as inputs with pull-ups
   - This is what the demo uses, and it works reliably in most cases
   - ⚠️ Some older PS/2 hosts may not reliably detect 3.3V logic high

2. **Bidirectional Level Shifter** (recommended for production use)
   - Use a 3.3V ↔ 5V bidirectional level shifter (e.g., TXS0102, BSS138-based)
   - Ensures proper voltage levels in both directions
   - Necessary for guaranteed compatibility with all PS/2 hosts
   - Protects RP2040 from potential 5V signals on misconfigured hosts

3. **Simple Transistor Level Shifter**
   - 2x N-channel MOSFETs (BSS138 or similar) for clock and data
   - 4x 10kΩ pull-up resistors
   - Cost-effective DIY solution

**For this demo project**, direct connection works fine with modern computers. For production keyboards intended for wide compatibility, use a proper level shifter.

### Pin Configuration

| Function | GPIO Pin | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Button | GP15 | Single key input (direct pin) |
| PS/2 Clock | GP16 | PS/2 clock line (bidirectional) |
| PS/2 Data | GP17 | PS/2 data line (bidirectional) |
| Mode Switch | GP14 | HIGH = USB mode, LOW = PS/2 mode |

**Wiring:**
- Pin 1 (Data) → GP17
- Pin 3 (GND) → GND
- Pin 4 (VCC) → 5V (VBUS)
- Pin 5 (Clock) → GP16

## Software Setup

### Prerequisites

1. [QMK Firmware](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started) installed
2. QMK CLI configured
3. ARM GCC toolchain

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository into your QMK keyboards directory:**

```bash
cd ~/qmk_firmware/keyboards
mkdir -p bjl  # Create the bjl directory first
cd bjl
git clone https://github.com/BuzzL123/qmk-single-button-ps2-usb-dual-mode-keyboard-demo.git ps2demo
```

Or if you want to keep your QMK directory clean, use **sparse checkout** to only get the keyboard files:

```bash
cd ~/qmk_firmware/keyboards
mkdir -p bjl/ps2demo  # Create both directories
cd bjl/ps2demo
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/BuzzL123/qmk-single-button-ps2-usb-dual-mode-keyboard-demo.git
git config core.sparseCheckout true
echo "*.c" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
echo "*.h" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
echo "*.json" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
echo "*.mk" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
git pull origin main
```

This will only download the firmware files (`.c`, `.h`, `.json`, `.mk`) and skip documentation/extras.

2. **Compile the firmware:**

```bash
qmk compile -kb bjl/ps2demo -km default
```

3. **Flash to your RP2040:**

```bash
# Put your board into bootloader mode (double-tap reset or hold BOOTSEL while plugging in)
qmk flash -kb bjl/ps2demo -km default
```

Alternatively, manually copy the `.uf2` file to the RPI-RP2 drive that appears.

## Usage

### USB Mode

1. Set the mode switch to HIGH (or disconnect from GND)
2. Connect via USB
3. The keyboard will enumerate as a standard USB HID device
4. Press the button to send 'A' key

### PS/2 Mode

1. Set the mode switch to LOW (connect to GND)
2. Connect the PS/2 cable to your computer
3. Power the RP2040 via USB (for power only) or external 5V source
4. Press the button to send PS/2 scan codes:
   - Make code: `0x1C` (key down)
   - Break code: `0xF0 0x1C` (key up)
5. Hold the button for typematic repeat (auto-repeat after 500ms)

## PS/2 Protocol Implementation

This firmware implements PS/2 Scan Code Set 2 as a **device** (keyboard), including:

### Transmission Format

Each byte sent over PS/2 consists of 11 bits:
```
[Start] [D0] [D1] [D2] [D3] [D4] [D5] [D6] [D7] [Parity] [Stop]
   0     LSB                              MSB    Odd      1
```

### Timing Characteristics

- Clock frequency: ~12.5 kHz (40μs half-period)
- Inter-byte delay: 2ms
- Idle state: Both clock and data HIGH

### Key Features

- **Make Codes**: Sent when key is pressed
- **Break Codes**: Two-byte sequence (`0xF0` + scan code) sent when key is released
- **E0 Extended Codes**: Automatic handling for navigation, arrows, multimedia keys
- **Complete Key Support**:
  - All standard keys (A-Z, 0-9, symbols, modifiers)
  - Function keys (F1-F24)
  - Navigation cluster (Insert, Delete, Home, End, Page Up/Down)
  - Arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right)
  - Numeric keypad (full support)
  - Multimedia keys (Volume, Play/Pause, Next/Previous, Stop)
  - Browser controls (Back, Forward, Refresh, Home, Search, Favorites)
  - Application launchers (Mail, Calculator, My Computer)
  - Power management (Power, Sleep, Wake)
  - International keys (Japanese and Korean keyboard support)
- **Typematic Repeat**: 
  - Delay: 500ms before repeat starts
  - Rate: ~30 repeats per second (33ms interval)
  - Works with all keys including E0-prefixed keys

## Debugging

### Serial Debug Output

The firmware includes debug output via USB serial (CONSOLE feature enabled):

```bash
# Monitor serial output
qmk console
```

Example output:
```
================================
Mode: PS/2
================================
[PS2] Initializing PS/2 device...
[PS2] PS/2 device initialized (CLK=GP16, DATA=GP17)
[KEY] keycode=4, pressed=1, mode=PS/2
[PS2] Sending PS/2 make code for A (0x1C)...
[PS2] Typematic repeat armed
```

### Testing with Python

To verify PS/2 output, use the included `ps2_decoder.py` script on a second Raspberry Pi Pico:

1. Upload `ps2_decoder.py` to a second Pico using Thonny or mpremote
2. Wire GP16 (Clock) and GP17 (Data) to your keyboard's PS/2 lines
3. Run the script and press keys

The decoder will show:
```
✓ KEY DOWN: A
  Break prefix (0xF0)
✓ KEY UP:   A
```

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md#for-testingdebugging) for detailed instructions.

## Customization

### Adding More Keys

The firmware includes **complete PS/2 Scan Code Set 2 support**, so you can add any standard keyboard key to your keymap!

Edit `keymaps/default/keymap.c` and `info.json` to add more keys:

```c
// Example: 3-key keyboard
const uint16_t PROGMEM keymaps[][MATRIX_ROWS][MATRIX_COLS] = {
    [0] = LAYOUT_ortho_1x3(
        KC_A, KC_B, KC_C
    )
};
```

```c
// Example: Full row with multimedia
const uint16_t PROGMEM keymaps[][MATRIX_ROWS][MATRIX_COLS] = {
    [0] = LAYOUT_ortho_1x6(
        KC_ESC, KC_VOLU, KC_VOLD, KC_MUTE, KC_MPLY, KC_CALC
    )
};
```

**No additional coding required!** The firmware automatically:
- Maps QMK keycodes to PS/2 scancodes
- Sends E0 prefix for extended keys
- Handles typematic repeat for all keys

### Supported Key Categories

All of these work out of the box:

| Category | Example Keys | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| **Letters** | KC_A through KC_Z | Standard |
| **Numbers** | KC_1 through KC_0 | Standard |
| **Function Keys** | KC_F1 through KC_F24 | F13-F24 supported |
| **Modifiers** | KC_LSFT, KC_LCTL, KC_LALT, KC_LGUI | Left and right |
| **Navigation** | KC_HOME, KC_END, KC_PGUP, KC_PGDN | Auto E0 prefix |
| **Arrows** | KC_UP, KC_DOWN, KC_LEFT, KC_RGHT | Auto E0 prefix |
| **Editing** | KC_INS, KC_DEL, KC_BSPC | Auto E0 prefix |
| **Multimedia** | KC_MUTE, KC_VOLU, KC_VOLD, KC_MPLY | Auto E0 prefix |
| **Browser** | KC_WSCH, KC_WHOM, KC_WBAK, KC_WFWD | Auto E0 prefix |
| **Applications** | KC_MAIL, KC_CALC, KC_MYCM | Auto E0 prefix |
| **Power** | KC_PWR, KC_SLEP, KC_WAKE | Auto E0 prefix |
| **Keypad** | KC_P0 through KC_P9, KC_PPLS, KC_PMNS | Full numpad |
| **International** | KC_INT1 through KC_INT5, KC_LNG1, KC_LNG2 | Japanese/Korean |

### Adjusting Typematic Rate

Modify the typematic settings in `keyboard.c`:

```c
typematic.repeat_delay = 250;  // Start repeat after 250ms
typematic.repeat_rate = 50;    // 50ms between repeats (20 Hz)
```

Or call at runtime:
```c
ps2_set_typematic_rate(250, 50);
```

## Technical Details

### Why PS/2 Device Mode?

Most PS/2 projects implement **host** mode (reading from a PS/2 keyboard). This project implements **device** mode, making the RP2040 *act as* a PS/2 keyboard. This is much rarer and more complex!

### Challenges Solved

1. **Timing Precision**: PS/2 requires precise timing (~40μs per half clock cycle)
2. **Idle State Management**: Lines must be properly released between transmissions
3. **Inter-byte Delays**: Receiver needs time to process each byte
4. **Typematic Repeat**: Firmware must handle key repeat timing

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Host-to-device command handling (LED updates, scan code set switching)
- [ ] Full keyboard matrix support
- [x] **Full scancode support** - Complete PS/2 Scan Code Set 2 implementation
- [ ] PS/2 host mode (for connecting PS/2 keyboards to USB)
- [ ] Bidirectional PS/2 communication
- [x] **Extended scan codes** - Multimedia keys, browser controls, power management, F13-F24

## Troubleshooting

### Keyboard not recognized in PS/2 mode

- Check wiring (especially clock and data)
- Verify 5V power to PS/2 port
- Ensure mode switch is set to LOW (PS/2 mode)
- Check debug console for initialization messages
- **Voltage level issues**: If your PS/2 host doesn't recognize the keyboard, it may not accept 3.3V logic levels. Try using a bidirectional level shifter (3.3V ↔ 5V)

### Keys not registering

- Monitor serial debug output
- Verify button is connected to correct GPIO
- Check that firmware is in correct mode
- If in PS/2 mode, ensure the host computer recognizes the device first

### Typematic repeat not working

- Ensure you're holding the key for > 500ms
- Check debug output for "Typematic repeat" messages
- Verify `ps2_device_task()` is being called regularly

### Intermittent PS/2 behavior

- This is often a voltage level issue
- Add a bidirectional level shifter between RP2040 and PS/2 connector
- Ensure good connections (no loose wires)
- Check that pull-up resistors are properly configured
